**Project Title**: Analyzing the Impact of Remote Work on Employee Mental Health and Job Satisfaction 

**Problem Statement:** 
As remote work becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding its effects on employee mental 
health and job satisfaction is critical for organizations. This project explores how different work 
arrangements (remote, hybrid, onsite) influence stress levels, social isolation, and overall job 
satisfaction across various demographics and industries. By visualizing these relationships, HR 
professionals and organizational leaders can identify potential areas for improvement and tailor 
their mental health support initiatives accordingly.
